# Assignment 2: Electronic Keyboard
The objective of this assignment is to develop an electronic keyboard using the C8051F120 microcontroller and associated peripheral interface board. The software is written in C.
The basic concept uses the Peripheral Interface Board pushbuttons as 'keys' where each press of a 'key' will generate a corresponding audio frequency as per the piano frequency scale. Each required audo frequency is generated by outputting a squared wave of the required frequency to the digital to analog converter (DAC). The volume is controlled by changing the voltage level of the logic 1 of the square wave.

## Innovation
* The user can choose to  output a sine wave to the DAC or a square wave.
* The LCD screen will display the note being played, the volume level selected and the wave mode selected, and the authors' names.
* The user can select demo mode where the 'keyboard' will play London Bridge and light up the LEDs corresponding to the notes being played.
* The user can also select octave mode where the notes are one octave up
